6. **Download the robot test files:**
   - Open `main.py` and write your MicroPython code.
   - Ensure all code is in the `main.py` file.

6. **Write MicroPython Code:**
   - Open `main.py` and write your MicroPython code.
   - Ensure all code is in the `main.py` file.

7. **Run MicroPython Code:**
   - Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - Right-click in the editor and choose "Run..." to execute your MicroPython code.

8. **Additional Notes:**
   - **Main File Limitation:**
     - MicroPython programs for Raspberry Pi Pico must be named `main.py`. Ensure your main code is in a file named `main.py` for the bootloader to execute it on startup.
