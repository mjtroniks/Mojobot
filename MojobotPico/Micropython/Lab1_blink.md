# Blink Onboard LED

## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost microcontroller board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

## Key Features:

Microcontroller: Powered by the RP2040 chip, featuring a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor running at up to 133MHz.

Connectivity: Offers 26 multifunction GPIO pins, USB 1.1 support, UART, SPI, and I2C interfaces.

Memory: Equipped with 264KB of embedded SRAM and 2MB of external flash memory.

Low Power: Designed for energy efficiency, suitable for battery-powered applications and IoT devices.

Development Environment: Supported by MicroPython, C/C++, and CircuitPython for firmware development.

## Overview

This tutorial is a quick guide to blinking the onboard LED using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 

1. Make sure Python 3 or above has been installed on your computer as described in LAB0_IDE Setup
   You can verify Python is installed by typing CMD in the search box next to the Windows logo
   
   
   ![Capture](https://github.com/mjtroniks/Mojobot/assets/91319956/375be4bb-851f-46e2-ae6b-ec9ec7bcc99e)


   Then type python --version, if the python version is displayed as in the picture below you are ready to go. Otherwise proceed to Lab0_IDE Setup Instructions

2. Connect Raspberry Pi Pico to your Computer using a USB mini cable

3. Make sure Pycharm IDE is Installed and configured as in LAB0_IDE Setup

4. Create a project and make sure create main.py is selected

![Create new project](https://github.com/mjtroniks/Mojobot/assets/91319956/465d9c90-44bc-4e4b-89c8-d8ddb3b7082d)

5. Install Micropython plugin by Clicking File => Settings => Plugins
 You will be asked to restart the Pycharm IDE. Click on restart.

9. Paste the following code on the main file
    ![Downloading Examples](https://github.com/mjtroniks/Mojobot/assets/91319956/a793520d-d099-4fe4-8bf9-e2bdad74fefe)

   ```python
   
   import machine
   from time import *
   
   # Define the LED pin
   led = machine.Pin("LED", machine.Pin.OUT)
   
   # Main loop to toggle the LED
   while True:
       # Turn on the LED
       led.on()
   
       # Pause for 0.5 seconds
       sleep(0.5)
   
       # Turn off the LED
       led.off()
   
       # Pause for 0.5 seconds
       sleep(0.5)

11. Run the code by clicking on Run => Run Flash
