Description:
This code measures the distance using an ultrasonic sensor and prints the result in centimeters.
It uses the time_pulse_us function for accurate pulse width measurement and calculates distance
based on the duration of the pulse. The measurement stops if the user interrupts (e.g., keyboard interrupt).

Pin Configuration:
- Trigger Pin: GP14 (Output)
- Echo Pin: GP15 (Input)
