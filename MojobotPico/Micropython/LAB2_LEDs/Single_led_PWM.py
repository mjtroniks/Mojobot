Description:
This code demonstrates PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) on a Raspberry Pi MojobotPico using MicroPython.
It gradually increases and decreases the duty cycle of an LED connected to pin GP28, creating
a smooth fading effect.

Pin Configuration:
# LEDL (Left LED)
- R: GP22
- B: GP21
- G: GP20

# LEDR (Right LED)
- R: GP28
- B: GP27
- G: GP26
